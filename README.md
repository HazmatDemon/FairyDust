#### An MMORPG game in early development stage.

Fairy Dust is being crated by me since 2010. Everything started back when I discovered this game called Shaiya. 
I really loved that game but it was't perfect... So my dream was to build my own game that will be better (hopefully). 
I tried many diffrent engines like UE, Unity, jMonkeyEngine, but nothing worked for me. For next few years Fairy Dust stayed
inside my head and I was actually gonna abondon it. Fast forward to 2018 I discovered [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) :). 
It made my life great again.

### How to play it ?

### Binary

You can find exported game on this [Realeses](https://github.com/HazmatDemon/fairy-dust-client/releases) page.

### Export it your self

You can also clone this repository and export it, but you have to use my custom build of Godot. 
It contains a few tools that were essential to me (Discord Game SDK, SQLite). 
You will find more details once you visit this [site](https://github.com/HazmatDemon/godot).

Note: Keep in mind that this is multiplayer game and it requires a dedicated server.
